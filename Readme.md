# Project Name

## Project Description

(Provide a brief description of your project here)

## Prerequisites

- Python
- pip
- Node.js
- npm
- React

## Backend Setup

1. Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your machine.
2. Create a virtual environment using conda or venv.
3. Activate the virtual environment.
4. Navigate to the backend directory of the project.
5. Install the necessary Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Frontend Setup

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, download and install Node.js and npm from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). It's recommended to download the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability.
2. Verify the installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in the terminal. These commands should display the installed versions of Node.js and npm, respectively.
3. Navigate to the frontend directory of the project.
4. Install the necessary npm packages by running `npm install`.
5. Start the frontend server by running `npm start`.

## Running the Project

After setting up both the backend and frontend, you should be able to run the project. If the frontend server was started successfully, it should open a new browser window pointing to `localhost:3000` (or another port if specified differently in the project).

## Note

While it's not strictly necessary to have the exact same version of Node.js, it's generally a good idea to use the same version to avoid potential compatibility issues. Different versions of Node.js may have differences in their APIs and behavior, which could cause the project to behave differently.

However, if the exact version is not available or there are other constraints, using a version that's close enough (preferably in the same major version) should usually work. It's also important to note that the project's dependencies might have their own Node.js version requirements, which can be found in their respective documentation.

In case of any issues, the `package.json` file can specify a `engines` field that indicates the version of Node.js that your project is expected to use. If this field is present, it's recommended to use the specified version.
